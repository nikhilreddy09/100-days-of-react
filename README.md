# 100-days-of-react
This repository is dedicated to 100 days of react challenge where ill be posting updates each and every day

I am starting with Learn React Js by freecodecamp.org on Youtube on my first day of react.

<p>I have started creating a react application called to-do-list, <a href="https://github.com/nikhilreddy09/to-do-list">Click here for repo.</a> </p>


<h1>Day 1</h1>
1. I have started to learn ReactDOM and JSX.<br>
2. Functional Components.<br>
3. Parent child Components.<br>

<p>We can use ReactDom to render the required content. we need to import react-dom before we can start using it </p>
<code>import ReactDom from 'react-dom'</code>
we can use this statement in the file where we want to render the data.
<code>ReactDom.render("Data to be rendered" , document.getElementById("root")</code>

<p>we can have html elements as the first argument and the second argument serves as the place where the react needs to be rendered in the html page. Here we selected root id.</p>

<h4>Functional Components</h4>
<p> functional components are nothing but the seperate functions that are passed to ReactDom to render.</p>
<p>For example if we have a function such as </p>
<code> function App() {
 //data to be rendered
    }
  </code>
  <p>We can use this in the ReactDom render as follows :</p>
  <code> ReactDom.render( "Name", document.getElementById("root")</code>
  <p>We substitue the name as ("'<'App'/>'") in the above method to render the App function. remove the inverted commas.</p>
  
  <h4>Parent child components</h4>
  <p>Parent child components is something similar to functional components where inside the App function we have several small child components which render a specific task. for example having header , nav , footer inside the app function so that its easy to findout which function is rendering which element.</p>
  
  <p>if we are defining the function in another file we need to export those function by using.</p>
  <code> export default "Function name"</code>
  <p>and then import the function in the file we are using it by using import statement as follows.</p>
  <code> import Name from "path"</code>
  
  <p>We can style the files in react by using css. we need to import the CSS file by using the import statement as follows . suppose the css file name is App.css then :</p>
  <code>
 import './App.css'
</code>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
1. props <br>
<p>Inorder to get javascript into JSX file we use curly braces around it "{ }" . for example if we want to access a variable named age inside our jsx we do the following inside the opening and closing tags.
 <code> <Tagopen>my age is {age} </tagclose></code>
 <p>Props in react are used to send data to the function that we want to render on our screen . we can send props in form of javascript object . </p>
 <code>  
contact = {{name : "Nikhil" , phone : "1234567890" , email : "n@gmail.com"}} 
</code> . 
<p>We can send this object to the tag that it refers to and it is stored inside of props</p>
<code>
 function tag(props) {
   console.log(props.contact.name)
 }
</code>
<p>In this way we can send data to the function using props and sending it in the form of objects.</p>
<p>Here i have created a simple application to see how we can work with props in react : https://github.com/nikhilreddy09/props-react</p>
<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>Today i have been learning about mapping components. </p>
<p>I have included a small project on how mapping components work here : https://github.com/nikhilreddy09/mapping-components-react</p>
<h1>Day 4</h1>
<p>Today i have started learning about class components.</p>
<p> We can use the class components by extending the class which we want to create with React.Component so that we can use some of the properties from Component.</p>
<p>We need to put everything we want to render inside render function within class component for example :</p>
<code>
 class ToDoItem extends React.Component {
     
    render() {
      return (
        <div className="todo-item">
            <input type="checkbox" checked={this.props.completed} />
          <p>{this.props.text}</p>
        </div>
        )
    }
}

</code>

<p>Here we have created a class ToDoItem which extends React.Component and then used a render function to render the data within.</p>
<p>In order to access props within class componnet we do that by using this.props.name to get the prop with key as name</p>

<h4>State</h4>
<p> we use state instead of props so that we can change the incoming data . props are immutable but we can change the value of the state</p>
<p> we can use state in our code as follows :</p>
<code>
constructor(){
 super()
 this.state = {
                 key : "value" 
              }
}
}
</code>
<p>we use super() to access some of the components from the parent component class which we extend</p>
<p>here state is something like an object which has values in it. we can access values in state inside render() by using this.state.name where name is the key of the state. </p>
<h4>handling events in react</h4>
<p>In react its we can handling events similar to how we handle in html but with slight difference. for example : if we have a button we can use <b>onClick={ () => { console.log("button clicked")} }</b> . here we have described a function inside curly braces to do the following event whenever the button is clicked. for further reference on events visit this URL : https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events</p>

<h4>Changing state in React</h4>
<p>We can change the state in react by using setState method . i have created a small application which demonstrates a change of state when a button is clicked. https://github.com/nikhilreddy09/Changing-state-react</p>
<h1>Day 5</h1>
<p>Today i have been learning more about state and the differences between state and props and how to use the setState function more efficiently.</p>
<h1>Day 6 and Day 7</h1>
<p>I havent done really anything on day 6 and day 7 . i have been working on d3js and android as well . so couldnt find time for react these days. i will make sure that i dont repeat this again.</p>
<h1>Day 8</h1>
<p>Toady i have purchased a course from udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/ this is the course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller ,  which covers almost everything in React. i will be working on this course from today and will share the progress everyday.</p>
<p>Today i have sucessfully completed the getting started module in the course where i saw why we use react , what are SPA's and everything. I also had a refresher training on ES6 JS where i saw how to use let and const keywords , arrow functions , Imports & Exports and classes </p>
<h1>Day 9</h1>
<p>Today i have started learning about spread and rest operators.</p>
<h4>Spread operator</h4>
<p>we can use spread operator(...)to add elements to array or objects</p>
<code> let number = [1,2,3]
       let newnumber = [...number , 4,5]</code>
 <p>Now if we console log new number it will take elements from the first array and add 4,5 and gives us the output as [1,2,3,4,5]</p>
<h4>Rest operator</h4>
<code> const f = (...args) => { return args.sort()}</code>
<p>here the ...args takes in any number of arguments and stores it into array without actually specifying the number of arguments for the function.</p>
<h4>Destructuring</h4>
<p>used to easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables.</p>
<h1>Day 10</h1
<p> today i have completed the js refresher training and headed towards understanding how react works and JSX as well. had a good practice on props again and how React.CreateElement works . </p>
<h1>Day 11</h1>
<p>Today i have gone through understanding props and state , Handling events with methods , Manipulating the states and using one of the react Hooks useState to change the state in a functional component and i have also checked the basics on stateless and statefull components.</p>
